# About this repository #

## Who is working on it? ##
My name is Joost, I'm an aspiring frontend software developer, learning to make great websites and other applications.
May 2022 myself and about 15 other students enrolled in a 6-month, -fulltime- web development course at TechGrounds.

### What are you guys learning? ###

* Hard Skills 

First we learn about the basics of HTML and (S-)CSS. HTML Basics covers subjects as semantics, accessibility, forms and input types. CSS and SASS Fundamentals is about positioning, naming conventions, flex-box, pseudo-elements, transitions, responsive design and more.

You can find my results of the assignments in this repository.

Next step is to learn JavaScript. I'll add more info soon.

* Soft Skills

Studying at TechGrounds we work (remotely) in small teams applying the SCRUM-method with a standup every morning, sprints, reviews, a back-log and so on. Also peer-learning is an important set of skills we use to share our knowledge and questions.

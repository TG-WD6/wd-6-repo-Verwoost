        <h2>Tigers</h2>
        <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.
            It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.
            An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar.
            It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat,
            which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.
            Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years,
            then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.
            The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region
            in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas
            to Bali in the Sunda Islands.
            Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been
            extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali,
            and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China.
            Today, the tiger's range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and
            tropical forests
            on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and Sumatra.
            The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.
            As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature
            individuals,
            with most of the populations living in small isolated pockets.
            India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population decline are habitat
            destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching.
            Tigers are also victims of human-wildlife conflict, particularly in range countries with a high human
            population density.

            The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna.
            It featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range,
            and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags,
            coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams.
            The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.

        <h2>Lions</h2>
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
            broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
            dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species,
            forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
            Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and
            keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans,
            the species typically does not.

            The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but
            when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion
            ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia, but it has been
            reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been
            listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined
            by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas.
            Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the
            greatest causes for concern.

            One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in
            sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept
            in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in
            zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent
            in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's
            historic and current range.

    <section class="monkeys" id="monkeys">
        <h2>Monkeys</h2>
        <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the
            simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the
            apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea)
            are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to their scope.[citation
            needed][3]

            In 1812, Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together and established the
            name Catarrhini, "Old World monkeys", ("singes de l'Ancien Monde" in French).[3][4][5] The extant sister of
            the Catarrhini in the monkey ("singes") group is the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).[3] Some nine million
            years before the bifurcation between the Cercopithecidae and the apes,[citation needed] the Platyrrhini
            emerged within "monkeys" by migration to South America from Afro-Arabia (the Old World),[citation needed]
            likely by ocean.[6][better source needed] The apes are thus deep in the tree of extant and extinct monkeys,
            and any of the apes is distinctly closer related to the Cercopithecidae than the Platyrrhini are.

            Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the
            ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally
            considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.

            Within suborder Haplorhini, the simians are a sister group to the tarsiers – the two members bifurcated some
            60 million years ago. New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians roughly 35 million
            years ago. Old World monkeys and apes emerged within the catarrhine monkeys about 25 million years ago.
            Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus (35–32 million years ago) are also considered
            monkeys by primatologists.[7][6][8][9][10][11]

            Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates (suborder
            Strepsirrhini). The simians' sister group, the tarsiers, are also haplorhine primates; however, they are
            also not monkeys.

            Apes emerged within "monkeys" as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are
            monkeys as well. There has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so "Old
            World monkey" may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhini
            (including apes).[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] That apes are monkeys was already realized by
            Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century.[21] Linnaeus placed this group in 1758 together
            with the tarsiers, in a single genus "Simia" (sans Homo), an ensemble now recognised as the Haplorhini.[22]

    <section class="hippo" id="hippo">
        <h2>Hippopotamus</h2>
        <p>The hippopotamus, also called the hippo, common
            hippopotamus, or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is one
            of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis
            liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis). Its name comes from the ancient Greek for "river horse"
            (ἱπποπόταμος).

            After the elephant and rhinoceros, the hippopotamus is the third-largest land mammal and is the heaviest
            extant land artiodactyl. Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed
            ungulates, the closest living relatives of the Hippopotamidae are cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises,
            etc.), from which they diverged about 55 million years ago. Hippos are recognisable for their barrel-shaped
            torsos, wide-opening mouths with large canine tusks, nearly hairless bodies, pillar-like legs, and large
            size: adults average 1,500 kg (3,310 lb) for bulls and 1,300 kg (2,870 lb) for cows. Despite its stocky
            shape and short legs, it is capable of running 30 km/h (19 mph) over short distances.

            Hippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and mangrove swamps. Territorial bulls each preside over a stretch of water
            and a group of five to thirty cows and calves. Reproduction and birth both occur in the water. During the
            day, hippos remain cool by staying in water or mud, emerging at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippos rest
            near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos typically do not display territorial
            behaviour on land. Hippos are among the most dangerous animals in the world due to their highly aggressive
            and unpredictable nature. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory (canine
            teeth).</p>
